## Usage

The webpage is designed to be responsive and adapt to different screen sizes. Here's how the layout changes based on the viewport width:

- On large screens (≥ 1024px), the full website title is displayed, and the navigation links are shown as text.
- On medium screens (≥ 768px), the full website title is displayed, and the navigation links are shown as text.
- On small screens (< 768px), an abbreviated website title is displayed, and the navigation links are shown as emoji icons.

You can customize the content, styling, and layout of the webpage by modifying the HTML and CSS files. Tailwind CSS provides a comprehensive set of utility classes to style your components quickly and efficiently.
